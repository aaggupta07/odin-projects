            <li>Pour 1/2 tsp of olive oil over the chicken breast, then use a brush to evenly disperse the oil and seasoning.</li>
            <li>Flip chicken breast over and repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>Turn the stove on to medium heat, and allow pan to warm for around 5 minutes (until lightly steaming).</li>
            <li>Place chicken breast on pan, cook for 1 to 2.5 minutes based on thickness.</li>
            <li>Flip and cook the other side. Take chicken breast off the pan when internal temperature has reached above 140&deg;F.</li>
