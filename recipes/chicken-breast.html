            <ol>
                <li>Cut chicken breast so that each piece has roughly uniform thickness.</li>
                <li>Using a paper towel, lightly dab the chicken breast, removing moisture off the surface and flattening the chicken breast. Flip over and repeat.</li>
                <li>Evenly season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and ground cumin, as well as garlic powder if desired.</li>
                <li>Pour 1/2 tsp of olive oil over the chicken breast, then use a brush to evenly disperse the oil and seasoning.</li>
                <li>Flip chicken breast over and repeat on the other side.</li>
                <li>Turn the stove on to medium heat, and allow pan to warm for around 5 minutes (until lightly steaming).</li>
                <li>Place chicken breast on pan, cook for 1 to 2.5 minutes based on thickness.</li>
                <li>Flip and cook the other side. Take chicken breast off the pan when internal temperature has reached above 140&deg;F.</li>
                <li>Allow chicken breast to rest for around five minutes.</li>
